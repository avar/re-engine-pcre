[Changes for 0.12 - 2007-07-12]

* Release by: Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason

* Moved all the pcre \.[ch]$ files into libpcre, the build system in
  now in two parts.

  This makes things a bit cleaner and PCRE.h and pcre.h should not
  clash any more on case-insensitive file systems.

* t/split-null.t: New failing test for split //

* t/split.t: Fixet typo: foo|bar => x|y, test still fails though

* t/perl/regexp_nc_tie.t: Pulled test from blead

* t/perl/regexp.t: Enabled more tests (e.g. named capture)

* Removed some C++ files from pcre that snuck in the distro

[Changes for 0.10 - 2007-06-23]

* Release from new comaint: Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason

* Rewrote the whole thing to work on the latest blead which has
  undergone massive changes in the regex API. Threw out the old
  re::engine::PCRE and started fresh with re::engine::Plan9 as a base.

* Upgraded to PCRE 7.2, now supports named captures

* Made s/// work. Offsets weren't properly populated in exec in the
  old version

* Brought back Module::Install to make the tarball huger than ever
  before, sorry Yves!

* Lots of tests including some from perl core in t/

[Changes for 0.09 - 2006-12-06]

* I missed a version check in the updated version of Makefile.PL
  Corrected here. Yves

[Changes for 0.08 - 2006-12-06]

* Complete changeover to XS and as part of that switch to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
  This release is 30k smaller compressed!
  
* Provide extra boot time logic to set up the correct pcre_malloc hooks
  so that the extension uses perls memory management routines and not
  malloc directly. This is especially important for threading as we have 
  to ensure we are using shared memory.

* Switch to a static build of PCRE, we dont need to export any of its API
  as we are statically linking to it anyway. This resolves some warnings 
  on Win32.

* Added a TODO list.

[Changes for 0.05 - 2006-12-05]

* Changes related to getting things to work on a threaded perl.
  This identified several issues with the API that needed to be 
  worked around. Once the appropriate patches are applied to perl
  they wont be needed.
